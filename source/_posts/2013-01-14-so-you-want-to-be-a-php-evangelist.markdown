### In the beginning...

Before diving deeper into the proposed subject, we need to understand some important concepts regarding this discussion. One of the most effective techniques to reach understanding about something is contextualization; putting ourselves into different contexts is what makes it possible for us to understand the facts differently and from a unique perspective. Therefore, let us define, on a specific context:

#### What is the meaning of the term "Evangelism"?

[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelism) gives us a full context definition of meaning:

> Evangelism is the preaching of the Christian Gospel or the practice of relaying information about a particular set of beliefs to others with the object of conversion.

As a matter of fact, the first reference we made, even know unconsciously, to the evangelism concept sits on the religious context. In that context, actually, is where we reach the full and most potential definition of the word; evangelize is to, effectivelly, transfer information regarding a set of beliefes to others, with the final goal of **conversion**.

The idea behind being a PHP Evangelist is, therefore, composed exactly by this conversion mentality, with passionate speech and, on top of all that, sustained by strong and durable arguments. This mentality is what will take people to not only start using the language, but also fall in love with it to, maybe someday, become evangelists was well.

### Enough of small talk

After this brief contextualization - I sincerely hope it was brief to you, let's get started with the good stuff: what do you need to start doing to become a PHP Evangelist?

#### Have a distinct knowledge about the language

One of the greatest peculiarity of technology evangelists is their knowledge on the subject they talk about. After all, how can you have solid and strong arguments in any technical debate without knowing pretty well what you are debating about? And I'm already wondering you ask:

> What sources should I use to get a distinct knowledge of the language?

My answer could not be more obvious: [the official docs](http://php.net/manual). When we deal with PHP, there is not one better learning and reaserching resource than the documentation. Complete as few others, always up-to-date and of extreme easy access; make it your main tool to evolve, study, research e even - why not - have fun.

> What will differentiate me from the usual community

A lot of things. But, for the sake of the example, I will tell you a few:

* **[RFC](https://wiki.php.net/rfc)** (Request for Comments)

Overview page of all RFC's related to PHP core development. That's where you will find the community feature implementation proposals for the language.

Knowing how the development of the technology you utilize is going can be a great advantage. Which features the community wish to see into the language *core*, which of these are actually going to be approved and be part of that *core* on the next stable versions and, mainly, what discussions have been driving those proposals and approvals.

* **Contribution**

We all know that, despite the importance of the theoretical knowledge about software engineering, architecture and modeling, the practice is what actually separates the men from the boys when it comes to programming.

In that sense, one of the great study tools you can use is open-source project contribution. A lot of times, just by watching the development of open-source projects that are reference for the language already helps you learn advanced features of that language, and consequently improve your technical knowledge.

If you are not sure on where to start or even to what project contribute, [GitHub](http://github.com) might help you. There you can find a [list](https://github.com/languages/PHP/most_watched) of the most watched projects and known written in PHP: frameworks, libraries and even language interpreters. A huge selection of highly potential projects and a lot of room for contribution.
